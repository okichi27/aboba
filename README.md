**This is my first GitHub repository !!**
Here are collected the materials of my study of the **OpenCV** and **MathPlotLib** libraries, some initial **instructions**, **tasks** that I had to perform during my studies.

## learning 
This section **also consists of 2 points,** so let's look at them:
1. **lib_matplotlib** - learning the MathPlotLib library;
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.

    - **3d**;
    - **basic**;
    - **plots of arrays and fields**;
    - **statistics plots**;
    - **unstructured coordinates**;
    - **MATPLOTLIB.pdf:** report on the work of each code.
   
2. **lib_opencv** - learning the OpenCV library.
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.
   
    - **basic:** codes + report to the topic;
    - **cont:** work with contours(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **histo:** work with histograms(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **trans:** work with transformations(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **others:** codes + report to the topic.
  
## tasks
This item lists the tasks described and uploaded to GitHub:
1. **repotrs**
There are tasks that were done with reports:
    - **ai.docx**; - description of artificial intelligence; 
    - **neural networks.docx**; - description of neural networks;
    - **Segmentation.pdf**; - description, instructions for downloading and running the best neural networks for object recognition.
   
2. **test10**
    - **-_-**;  
5. **calibration**
    - calibration **code**;
    - calibration **photo**; 
7. **test_conter**
    - several variations of working **codes** for individual images;
    - **images** on which testing was carried out;
    - additional **folder "add_nn",** in which there was an attempt to make part of the code through a neural network;
9. **test_pi**
    - test **code**;
    - **photo** test; 
11. **yolov**
    - **Тестування стандартних моделей YOLOv5 - График 1 - Line.pdf**; - Testing standard YOLOv5 models - Chart 1;
    - **Тестування стандартних моделей YOLOv5.pdf**; - Testing standard models YOLOv5;
    - **Тестування стандартних моделей YOLOv8.pdf**; - Testing standard models YOLOv8.
## instruction
In this sector, the instructions that I compiled during the execution of the previous tasks are collected.

- **instruction cv-pi.pdf**. About install OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 4B;   
- **instruction hotspot-pi.pdf**. About setting up a Wi-fi access point on Raspberry Pi 4B;
- **instruction ssh-pi.pdf**. About starting to use Raspberry Pi 4B via ssh;
- **instruction start-coral.pdf**. About starting to use Google Coral;
- **instruction yolov7-jetson.pdf**. About installing and running Yolo7 on Jetson Nano.
