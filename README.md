## learning and tasks
This is my first GitHub repository 😵‍💫. 
My tasks during training are publicly saved here (up to 7 tasks). You can take some time to familiarize yourself with my work in Python and the library OpenCV . Instructions on how to load libraries have also been added to some tasks 👀.
