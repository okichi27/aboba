**This is my first GitHub repository !!**
Here are collected the materials of my study of the **OpenCV** and **MathPlotLib** libraries, some initial **instructions**, **tasks** that I had to perform during my studies.


## learning and tasks
This is my first GitHub repository 😵‍💫. 
My tasks during training are publicly saved here (up to 7 tasks). You can take some time to familiarize yourself with my work in Python and the library OpenCV . Instructions on how to load libraries have also been added to some tasks 👀.
