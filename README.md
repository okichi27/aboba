**This is my first GitHub repository !!**
Here are collected the materials of my study of the **OpenCV** and **MathPlotLib** libraries, some initial **instructions**, **tasks** that I had to perform during my studies.

## learning 
This section **also consists of 2 points,** so let's look at them:
1. **lib_matplotlib** - learning the MathPlotLib library;
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.
    - 3d
    - basic.m
    - plots of arrays and fields
    - statistics plots
    - unstructured coordinates
    - MATPLOTLIB.pdf - report on the work of each code
   
3. **lib_opencv2** - learning the OpenCV library.
