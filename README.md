**This is my first GitHub repository !!**
Here are collected the materials of my study of the **OpenCV** and **MathPlotLib** libraries, some initial **instructions**, **tasks** that I had to perform during my studies.

## learning 
This section **also consists of 2 points,** so let's look at them:
1. **lib_matplotlib** - learning the MathPlotLib library;
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.

    - **3d**;
    - **basic**;
    - **plots of arrays and fields**;
    - **statistics plots**;
    - **unstructured coordinates**;
    - **MATPLOTLIB.pdf:** report on the work of each code.
   
2. **lib_opencv** - learning the OpenCV library.
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.
   
    - **basic:** codes + report to the topic;
    - **cont:** work with contours(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **histo:** work with histograms(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **trans:** work with transformations(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **others:** codes + report to the topic.
  
## tasks
This section :

## instruction
In this sector, the instructions that I compiled during the execution of the previous tasks are collected.

- **instruction cv-pi.pdf**.
About install OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 4B;   
- **instruction hotspot-pi.pdf**.
About setting up a Wi-fi access point on Raspberry Pi 4B;
- **instruction ssh-pi.pdf**. About starting to use Raspberry Pi 4B via ssh;
- **instruction start-coral.pdf**. About starting to use Google Coral;
- **instruction yolov7-jetson.pdf**. About installing and running Yolo7 on Jetson Nano.
