**This is my first GitHub repository !!**
Here are collected the materials of my study of the **OpenCV** and **MathPlotLib** libraries, some initial **instructions**, **tasks** that I had to perform during my studies.

## learning 
This section **also consists of 2 points,** so let's look at them:
1. **lib_matplotlib** - learning the MathPlotLib library;
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.
    - **3d**;
    - **basic**;
    - **plots of arrays and fields**;
    - **statistics plots**;
    - **unstructured coordinates**;
    - **MATPLOTLIB.pdf:** report on the work of each code.
   
2. **lib_opencv2** - learning the OpenCV library.
In turn, it consists of folders of materials divided by topic. Each contains **.py** files with code for each theme.   
    - **basic:** codes + report to the topic;
    - **cont:** work with contours(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **histo:** work with histograms(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **trans:** work with transformations(codes) + report to the topic;
    - **others:** codes + report to the topic.
